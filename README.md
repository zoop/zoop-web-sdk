## Zoop E-Sign Gateway

<a name="esignIntroduction"></a>

### 1. Introduction

As a registered ASP under ESP AadhaarAPI provide WEB and Mobile gateway for E-signing of
documents. Using these gateways any organisation on-boarded with us can get their documents
signed digitally by their customer using Aadhaar number based EKYC (performed on ESP portal).
The mode of transaction can be following:

1. Aadhaar Number + OTP (works only on web and android)
2. Aadhaar Number + Fingerprint (works only on windows machine and android)
3. Aadhaar Number + IRIS (works only on Samsung IRIS tablet)

This solves the problem of wet signing of documents, which is a costly and time-consuming
process. Aadhaar based E-sign is a valid and legal signature as per government regulations and is
accepted widely across India by various organizations.

<a name="esignProcessFlow"></a>

### 2. Process Flow

1. Generate the document based on the user info at your backend.
2. At your backend server, Initiate the e-sign transaction using a simple Rest API [POST] call by converting your
   document into base64 string or via our Multi-Part Upload API. Details of these are available in the documents
   later. You will require API key and Agency Id for accessing this API which can be generated from the Dashboard.
3. This gateway transaction id then needs to be communicated back to the frontend where SDK functions are to be
   called.
4. After including the SDK files (JS & CSS) at frontend and a small HTML snippet, client has to pass above
   generated transaction id to an SDK function to create a new gateway object and then open the gateway using
   another function call.
5. This will open the gateway as shown in above image and the rest of the process till response will be handled by
   the gateway itself.
6. Once the transaction is successful or failed, appropriate handler function will be called with response JSON, that
   can be used by the client to process the flow further.
7. Result PDF url will be sent to the responseUrl requested via INIT call.
8. Client will also have a REST API available to pull the status of a gateway transaction from backend and reason of
   failure.

<a name="esignEndUserFlow"></a>

### 3. End User Flow:

1. Customer Login [ E-mail + OTP | Gmail Login | Phone + OTP (beta) ]
2. Document displayed to customer. (Draggable signature option can be turned on via gateway config or
   signPageNumber and coordinates can be fixed during initiation call)
3. Customer chooses Mode of Authentication for performing E-Sign
4. Customer is redirected to ESP’s Auth portal where EKYC is performed after entering either Aadhaar number
   or Virtual Id.
5. After successful EKYC customer is displayed Sign details received and customer’s consent is taken to
   attach signature to the document and share a copy with requesting organization.
6. On success, customer is provided with an option to download the signed file. Also, a download URL is sent
   to customer’s Email and responseURL which is valid for 48 hours.
7. On failure during request to ESP, customer is displayed an error code and error message. Same error details
   are sent to the responseURL.
8. End Customer can validate the signature on PDF by opening the PDF in acrobat reader and Developer can
   programmatically fetch certificate from PDF to ensure validity of certificate if required.

### 4. Initiating a Gateway Transaction For E-Sign[IP Whitelisted In Production]

To initiate a gateway transaction a REST API call has to be made to backend. This call will
generate a **Gateway Transaction Id** which needs to be passed to the frontend web-sdk to launch
the gateway.

<a name="esignInitUrl"></a>

<a name="esignResponseParams"></a>

#### 4.4 Response Params:

```json
{
  "id": "<<transactionId>>",
  "docs": ["<<document ID>>"],
  "request version": "2.0",
  "createdAt": "<<timestamp>>"
}
```

The above generated gateway transactionId has to be made available to frontend to open the gateway.

**Note:** A transaction is valid only for 30 mins after generation.

<a name="setZoopEnv"></a>

### 5. Set Zoop Environment (mandatory for staging environment)

First, you might have to specify the environment in which you want the SDK to run. By default, **production** environment is picked if you forgot to specify any value. Valid environments are **production** and **staging**. To set the environment you call `setEnvironment` method from the provided SDK. This helps us to understand what type of transactions you are planning of doing.

```html
<script>
  zoop.setEnvironment("production"); // Use 'staging' for staging environment
</script>
```

<a name="esignAddSDK"></a>

### 6. Adding Web SDK To Your Project

You can download or add the link to the CDN of our Web SDK. There are two function calls to open the gateway. They should called in the order mentioned in the docs. Firstly, to initiate the gateway you have to call `zoop.eSignGatewayInit(gatewayOptions)` with the [gateway option](#esign-gateway-setup). The next step would be to open the gateway. That can be done by simply calling `zoop.eSignGateway(<<transaction_id>>)` with the transaction ID generated in the init call. For your ease we have also added one simple example below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Your Site</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- And add the code below into the body of your HTML -->
    <div id="zoop-gateway-model">
      <div id="zoop-model-content"></div>
    </div>
    <script src="https://static.aadhaarapi.com/sdk/v1.0.1/aadhaarapi-web-sdk.min.js"></script>
    <script type="application/javascript">
      // Name of the this function can be anything you want.
      function openGateway() {
         // To setup gateway UI to mach your application
         zoop.eSignGatewayInit(gatewayOptions);
         // Pass the transaction ID created at Init call
         zoop.eSignGateway(<<transaction_id>>);
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<a name="esign-gateway-setup"></a>

#### 6.1 Setup the gateway UI to match your application.

```js
const gatewayOptions = {
  company_display_name: "<<Add your company name here>>", //(required)
  color_ft: "FFFFFF", //(optional)Add the hex for colour of text of company name
  color_bg: "2C3E50", //(optional)Add the hex for background colour to be set for gateway.
  logo_url: "https://your-square-product-logo-image-url-here.png", //(required)
  otp_mode: "y", // (optional) default value is 'y'
  fp_mode: "n", //(optional) default value 'y'
  ir_mode: "n", //(optional) default value 'y',
  phone_auth: "n", //(optional) default value 'n',
  draggable_sign: "y", //(optional) default value ‘n’,
  google_sign: "n", //(optional) default value ‘y’
  customer_email: "name@example.com", // (optional) email id to prefill
  customer_phone: "9999999999", // (optional) phone number to prefill
};
```

<a name="esignEventTitle"></a>

### 7. Handle Events

Events are the way to acknowledge consumer of the SDK that something has happened. Listening of the events is same for each event.

```html
<script>
  zoop.on("close", (message) => {
    // handle the event
  });
  zoop.on("esign-result", (message) => {
    // handle the event
  });
  // and so on...
</script>
```

The `message` parameter is an object which has `action`, `payload`, and `isError` properties.

| Event Name (action) | Occurs When                                                | payload | isError |
| ------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-----: | ------- |
| `close`             | User manually clicks on the close icon                     |   No    | false   |
| `consent-denied`    | When user denies to it's consent for e-sign                |   No    | false   |
| `otp-error`         | When the user enters wrong otp more than 3 times in e-sign |   Yes   | true    |
| `gateway-error`     | If gateway encounters an unexpected error                  |   Yes   | true    |
| `esign-result`      | When signed in attached to the PDF                         |   Yes   | Maybe   |

<a name="message-payload"></a>

### 7.1 `payload`

The `message` that you will receive, in case of any type of event, may or may not have the `payload` property. In case of esign the payload would be one of the following.

<a name="message-esign-result"></a>

#### 7.1.1 `esign-result`

When you receive an event named `esign-result` that may or may not be an error type. You can check whether the event is an error or not with `isError` property. If the value is `true` then it's a error response. In case of success you will receive [success JSON response](#esignRespInitSuccess) and for error you will receive [error JSON response](#esignRespInitError)

<a name="message-otp-error"></a>

#### 7.1.2 `otp-error`

The `otp-error` event occurs when the user has entred wrong OTP more than 3 times. The format of the payload is given below.

```json
{
  "message": "Maximum OTP Tries Reached, Transaction Failed",
  "statusCode": 422
}
```

<a name="message-gateway-error"></a>

#### 7.1.3 `gateway-error`

When gateway encounters an unexpected error this event is fired. The format of payload is given below.

```json
{
  "message": "Transaction is already completed or errored out.",
  "statusCode": "412"
}
```

<a name="esignRespInit"></a>

## Zoop Bank Statement Analysis(BSA) Gateway

<a name="bsaIntro"></a>

### 1. INTRODUCTION

**Bank statement analyzer** predicts the worthiness of an individual and his/her credibility for a loan, after analyzing a considerable number of bank transactions, with the assistance of complex algorithm, text extraction, data categorization and smart analysis techniques.

<a name="bsaProcessFlow"></a>

### 2. PROCESS FLOW

1. At your backend server, Initiate the BSA transaction using a simple Rest API [POST] call. Details of these are available in the documents later. You will require API key and Agency Id for accessing this API which can be generated from the Dashboard.
2. This gateway transaction id then needs to be communicated back to the frontend to our Web SDK.
3. After adding the Web SDK in your project, client has to pass the above generated transaction id to an SDK function, called `zoop.initBsaGateway(<<transaction_id>>)` which is to help us acknowladge about the transaction.
4. After the initialization of the transaction, to open the gateway, you have to call `zoop.openBsaGateway()` function.
5. Once the transaction is successful or failed, the provided webhook will be called with the data about the transaction.
6. Client will also have a REST API available to pull the status of a gateway transaction from backend.

<a name="bsaInit"></a>

### 3. INITIATING A GATEWAY TRANSACTION

To initiate a gateway transaction a REST API call has to be made to backend. This call will generate a Gateway Transaction Id which needs to be passed to the frontend web-sdk to launch the gateway.

<a name="bsaInitUrl"></a>

#### 3.1 INIT URL:

    URL: POST: {{base_url}}/bsa/v1/init

**{{base_url}}**:

### 4.ADDING WEB SDK TO YOUR PROJECT

You can download or add the link to the CDN of our Web SDK. There are two function calls to open the gateway. They should called in the order mentioned in the docs. Firstly, to initiate the gateway you have to call `zoop.initBsaGateway(<<transaction_id>>)` with the transaction ID generated in the init call. The next step would be to open the gateway. That can be done by simply calling `zoop.openBsaGateway()` function. You don't need to provided the transaction ID here as you have already mentioned in `initBsaGateway`. For your ease we have also added one simple example below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <button onclick="openGateway()">Open BSA Gateway</button>
    <script type="application/javascript">
      // Name of the this function can be anything you want.
      function openGateway() {
        // Pass Transaction ID here.
        zoop.initBsaGateway("<<transaction_id>>");
        // Call this function to open the gateway
        zoop.openBsaGateway();
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 5. Handling Webhook Response

The webhook response will be sent to `webhook_url` provided at the init call. You might receive multiple responses for a single transaction. The response(s) will be send when the user start any kind of interaction with the gateway. When receiving the webhook response please match the webhook_security_key in the header of the request to be the same as the one provided in the init call. If they are not the same **you must abandon the webhook response**.

## ZOOP INCOME TAX RETURN (ITR) GATEWAY (Beta)

<a name="itrIntro"></a>

### 1. Introduction

Income Tax Return is the form in which assessee files information about his Income and tax thereon to Income Tax Department. The Zoop ITR Gateway allows allows you to fetch the tax returns of your client and make better business decision on them.

<a name="itrProcessFlow"></a>

### 2. Process Flow

1. At your backend server, Initiate the ITR transaction using a simple POST Rest API call. Details of these are available in the documents later. You will require API key and Agency Id for accessing this API which can be generated from the Dashboard. This gateway transaction id then needs to be communicated back to the frontend to our Web SDK.
2. This gateway transaction id then needs to be communicated back to the frontend to our Web SDK.
3. After adding the Web SDK in your project, client has to pass the above generated transaction id to an SDK function, called `zoop.initIncomeTaxReturns(gatewayOption)` which is to help us to under different requirement of the gateway you are trying to open.
4. After the initialization of the transaction, to open the gateway, you have to call `zoop.openIncomeTaxReturnsGateway(<<transaction_id>>)` function.
5. Once the transaction is successful or failed, the provided webhook will be called with the data about the transaction.
6. Client will also have a REST API available to pull the status of a gateway transaction from backend.

<a name="itrInit"></a>

### 3. INITIATING A GATEWAY TRANSACTION

To initiate a gateway transaction a REST API call has to be made to backend. This call will generate a Gateway Transaction Id which needs to be passed to the frontend web-sdk to launch the gateway.

<a name="itrInitUrl"></a>

### 4. Adding Web SDK To Your Project

You can download or add the link to the CDN of our Web SDK. There are two function calls to open the gateway. They should called in the order mentioned in the docs. Firstly, to initiate the gateway you have to call `zoop.initIncomeTaxReturns(gatewayOption)` with the gateway option to modify the gateway UI. The next step would be to open the gateway. That can be done by simply calling `zoop.openIncomeTaxReturnsGateway(<<transaction_id>>)` and pass the transaction id generated in the init call first parameter. For your ease we have also added one simple example below.

      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<a name="itrGatewayOption"></a>

#### 4.1 Gateway Option Format

The options parameter that is passed while calling `zoop.initIncomeTaxReturns` has the following format.

```js
const gatewayOption = {
  txt_color: "rgb(102,102,102)", // The text color
  bg_color: "rgb(243,243,243)", // The background color
  btn_color: "rgb(0,105,180)", // Color of the button
  btn_txt_color: "rgb(255,255,255)", // Color of the text in button
  logo_url: "https://your-awesome-logo.png" // The URL of your logo
};
```

**NOTE**: We pass the provided values through URL and because of that **support of HEX color values are not present**. You can provide alternative color formats like rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla etc.

<a name="itrHandlingEvents"></a>

#### 4.2 Handling Events

There are two events to acknowledge of the ongoing transaction to your frontend. On success `itr-success` event will be fired and respective callback will executed, similarly `itr-error` will be fired in case of any error in the transaction. You find the usage in the provided [demo](#itr-sdk-example).

#### 4.2.1 Event: `itr-success`

When ITR pulling is successful this event is fired and you will receive the `message` on the respective registered callback function. The `message` is an object with `action` and `payload` property on it.

The `payload` has `id`, `response_code`, and `response_message` properties.

| response_code | response_message           |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 101           | ITR transaction successful |

```json
{
  "action": "itr-success",
  "payload": {
    "id": "<<transaction_id>>",
    "response_code": "101",
    "response_message": "Transaction Successful"
  }
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Event: `itr-error`

This event is fired when any error occurred while processing the transaction and respective callback is called and `message` parameter is passed. The `message` is an object with `action` and `payload` property on it.

The `payload` has `id`, `response_code`, and `response_message` properties.

| response_code | response_message           |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 601           | Unknown Error              |
| 602           | Unable to download ITR     |
| 603           | Unable to process response |
| 604           | Unable to submit the OTP   |
| 605           | Unable to parse ITR        |
| 606           | Session expired or invalid |
| 611           | Service unavailable        |
| 612           | Otp retries exhausted      |

```json
{
  "action": "itr-error",
  "payload": {
    "id": "<<transaction_id>>",
    "response_code": "602",
    "response_message": "Unable to download ITR"
  }
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Event: `itr-consent-denied`

This event is fired when user don't want to agree going ahead with the transaction and explicitly _Deny_ the transaction in the gateway. The respective callback is called and `message` parameter is passed. The `message` is an object with `action` and `payload` property on it.

The `payload` has `id`, `response_code`, and `response_message` properties.

| response_code | response_message |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| 609           | Consent Denied   |

```json
{
  "action": "itr-consent-denied",
  "payload": {
    "id": "<<transaction_id>>",
    "response_code": "609",
    "response_message": "Consent Denied"
  }
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Event: `itr-gateway-terminated`

This event is fired when user explicitly closed the an going transaction. The respective callback is called and `message` parameter is passed. The `message` is an object with `action` and `payload` property on it.

The `payload` has `id`, `response_code`, and `response_message` properties.

| response_code | response_message   |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| 610           | Gateway Terminated |

```json
{
  "action": "itr-gateway-terminated",
  "payload": {
    "id": "<<transaction_id>>",
    "response_code": "610",
    "response_message": "Gateway Terminated"
  }
}
```
